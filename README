###### HOW TO USE THE GAME/HOW THE GAME WORKS ######

- In the main menu, the user can click on the start game button to start the game at level
one automatically
- The user can also click on the choose level button to choose a level map file (either with
the buttons for levels 1-5 or with the choose file button to choose another map, e.g. map 6)

- Once the game started, the user can move the player in all directions with the arrow keys
- The user can collect entities by colliding with them:
    - keys: the player can open doors if he possesses at least one key
    - coins: the player can collect coins to increase his speed by 20% each time (all coins are
    lost after colliding with an enemy or trap)
    - potions: the player can collect potions to be invincible for a short period of time
    - hearts: the player can collect hearts to increase his lives by 1 (if he is not at max health)
- Two types of dangerous obstacles exit:
    - enemies: roam the map without a particular pattern
    - traps: static objects (randomly colored flames)

- Traps and enemies can damage the player if he collides with them
    - The player can kill enemies by colliding with them while pressing an arrow key and the space bar
     at the same time
    - If the player collides with a trap or enemy, he loses one life, all his coins and becomes
    shortly invincible
- If the player loses all lives or the timer reaches 0, he loses the level and can restart it if
he wants to
- If the user wants to pause the game, he can press ESC, to continue he can press the continue
 button or ENTER
- The player can win the level by colliding with the exit while having at least one key

- When the player wins or loses, the endgame screen with the appropriate buttons appears (menu button,
next level OR restart level button depending on whether player won or lost)
    - if the next level button is pressed, the next level map is automatically loaded
    - alternatively, the user can go to the menu, hit the choose level button and choose a different
    level map file

- If the user wants to exit the game, he can press the exit button in the main menu
