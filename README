###### HOW TO USE THE GAME/HOW THE GAME WORKS ######

- In the main menu, the user can click on the start game button to start the game at level
one automatically
- The user can also click on the choose level button to choose a level map file (either with
the buttons for levels 1-5 or with the choose file button to choose another map, e.g. map 6)

- In the game, at the top of the screen the HUD is displaying useful information:
    - the number of hearts (lives) the player has left (starts at 5, which is the max; if the player
    has lost a life then displays an empty container, that could be refilled by collecting a heart)
    - the number of keys the player has collected (at least half of the total keys should be collected)
    - the number of killed enemies (kill count) (at least one kill is required to exit)
    - the number of coins the player has collected (each coin increases the speed by 20%, lost if hit)
    - the timer (starts at 3 minutes and decreases by 1 every second; at 0 the player loses the level)

- Once the game started, the user can move the player in all directions with the arrow keys
- The user can collect entities by colliding with them:
    - keys: the player can open doors if he possesses at least half of the total keys of the map
    (and the kill count > 0)
    - coins: the player can collect coins to increase his speed by 20% each time (all coins are
    lost after colliding with an enemy or trap)
    - potions: the player can collect potions to be invincible for a short period of time
    - hearts: the player can collect hearts to increase his lives by 1 (if he is not at max health)
- Two types of dangerous obstacles exit:
    - enemies: roam the map without a particular pattern
    - traps: static objects (randomly colored flames)

- Traps and enemies can damage the player if he collides with them
    - The player can kill enemies by colliding with them while pressing an arrow key and the space bar
     at the same time
    - If the player collides with a trap or enemy, he loses one life, all his coins and becomes
    shortly invincible
- If the player loses all lives or the timer reaches 0, he loses the level and can restart it if
he wants to
- If the user wants to pause the game, he can press ESC, to continue he can press the continue
 button (which is not active before pressing start game button at least once) or press ENTER instead
- The player can win the level by colliding with the exit while having at least one key

- When the player wins or loses, the endgame screen with the appropriate buttons appears (menu button,
next level OR restart level button depending on whether the player won or lost)
    - if the next level button is pressed, the next level map is automatically loaded
    - alternatively, the user can go to the menu, hit the choose level button and choose a different
    level map file

- If the user wants to exit the game, he can press the exit button in the main menu





###### BONUS FEATURES ######
IN A NUTSHELL: A LOT more UI elements than asked for, and they all match the Henry Porter theme, new items

timer, play through levels 1-5 automatically using the continue button), smart screens
that change depending on whether the user won or lost, smart camera that follows the player, etc.

#### !!!IMPORTANT!!! ####
Most of the bonus features are experienced the best way in the custom level map file "level-6.properties"
that is in the "maps" folder. The user can choose this file in the choose level screen to play the map.
